# basic-notion-agent
A very simple agent to use Notion documents as prompts to comment on other Notion documents.


## Testing

To test this functionality, create a copy of
`test.json.scaffold', name it `test.json`
and fill in the values with your correct values.
Then run:

    python3 main.py

It uses only standard library values.
Note that you need a real working Notion instance to call the APIs against.
